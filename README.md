# Satellite-computing-dataset
This dataset contains experimental data from COTS computing devices on two real satellites.

## Introduction

This repository contains telemetry and active experimental data collected from two satellites, **Baoyun** and **BUPT-1**. The dataset includes both on-orbit data and ground-based testbed data collected on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) computing devices. This data is crucial for understanding the energy and thermal challenges faced by COTS computing devices in space. We hope this dataset will inspire further research in the field of satellite computing.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two main folders corresponding to the two satellites, **Baoyun** and **BUPT-1**. Each folder contains telemetry data and processed data from active experiments conducted both in space (satellite) and on ground-based testbeds.

### 1. **Baoyun**
   - **Telemetry**: Contains telemetry data collected from the Baoyun satellite during its mission.
   - **Active experiment data**: Data from experiments conducted on the Baoyun satellite and on ground-based testbeds.
     - **satellite**: Experimental data collected from the Raspberry Pi device on Baoyun.
     - **ground**: Experimental data collected on ground-based testbeds.

### 2. **BUPT-1**
   - **Telemetry**: Contains telemetry data collected from the BUPT-1 satellite during its mission.
   - **Active experiment data**: Logs from experiments conducted on the BUPT-1 satellite and on ground-based testbeds.
     - **satellite**: Experimental data collected on the satellite.
       - **RPi**: Data collected from experiments conducted on Raspberry Pi devices on the satellite.
       - **Atlas**: Data collected from experiments conducted on Atlas 200DK computing devices,on the satellite.
     - **ground**: Experimental data collected on ground-based testbeds.
       - **RPi**: Ground-based data collected using Raspberry Pi devices.
       - **Atlas**: Ground-based data collected using  Atlas 200DK computing devices.
